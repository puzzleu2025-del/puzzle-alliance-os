# Puzzle Alliance OS

跨裝置的活動、任務、會議、行事曆與甘特圖協作平台。完整本機版使用 Vinext、Cloudflare D1 與 Drizzle；GitHub Pages 發布的是可供跨裝置檢視與操作的靜態預覽版。

## GitHub Pages

推送到 `master` 後，`.github/workflows/pages-preview.yml` 會建立並發布靜態預覽。儲存庫第一次啟用時，請在 GitHub 的 **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment** 選擇 **GitHub Actions**。

GitHub Pages 無法執行伺服器端 API 或 D1。線上互動版因此提供瀏覽器內的登入、註冊、核可與成員管理，資料只保存在目前瀏覽器；安全的正式登入與跨裝置共用資料仍需部署 Worker 後端。

## 活動報名中心

- 每場活動有獨立的主要報名表，可使用短答、段落、電子郵件、電話、數字、日期、單選、下拉、複選與同意勾選題。
- 公開連結只提供表單與送出功能，不公開其他人的填答；管理名單、顯示個資、對帳註記及 Excel 匯出需管理員權限。
- 對帳可標示未對帳、待確認、已對帳、已退款或無需付款，並保存備註；Excel 會一併輸出對帳與提醒欄位。
- 系統依活動日期計算前 5 天與前 1 天的提醒日期，並可產生每位參加者的郵件內容。真正的自動寄信仍需正式 Worker、排程觸發器與郵件供應商密鑰；GitHub Pages 預覽不會在背景寄信。
- GitHub Pages 預覽會把報名表、測試填答與對帳狀態保存在同一台裝置的瀏覽器中，方便跨分頁驗收；它不會跨裝置同步。正式版則使用 D1 的 `registration_forms` 與 `registration_submissions` 資料表。

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`
- Portable: Windows, macOS, or Linux; no Bash required
- Managed Linux: managed Linux runtime with Bash, `flock`, `curl`, `sha256sum`, and GNU `timeout`
- Git is required only for publishing

## Sites Lifecycle

The Sites initializer copies the shared starter and selects managed-linux only when `SITES_MANAGED_LINUX_CONTAINER=1`; otherwise it selects portable. It saves the selection only in ignored `.sites-runtime/execution-profile.json`. Both profiles copy/configure first, then use the plugin's separate `install-dependencies.mjs` step to measure installation independently. Edit source under `app/` and follow the Sites skill for installation, preview, builds, and publishing.

Whenever reopening or moving a checkout, run `node <plugin-root>/scripts/configure-execution-profile.mjs` before project commands. Profile changes do not alter tracked source or require reinstalling otherwise-valid dependencies; restart an existing preview to use the new selection. Do not commit or upload `.sites-runtime/`.

This starter does not use `wrangler.jsonc`.

`install:ci` runs `npm ci` once against the shared lockfile, disables parent-workspace discovery, and includes required dev/optional dependencies despite production/omit settings. Sharp defaults to prebuilt binaries unless explicitly configured otherwise. Do not overlap installers.

- **Portable:** Preserve host HOME, npm cache, registry, proxy, temporary paths, retry/concurrency settings, and lifecycle-script policy. Use `--prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund`.
- **Managed Linux:** Use the existing project-local HOME/cache/tmp setup and Linux install lock, tarball preflight, and timeout. Restore the image-seeded npm cache only when its lockfile hash matches; retain network fallback. Builds keep their existing timeout. These helpers are not invoked by the portable profile.

`scripts/sites-env.mjs` preserves the caller's HOME, npm cache, proxy, XDG, and temporary-directory configuration while defaulting Wrangler and Miniflare state to the checkout. If npm reports an unwritable cache, select a writable path with `npm_config_cache` for that install. The `dev` and `start` scripts also keep Wrangler logs inside the checkout. Generated `.sites-runtime/` and `.wrangler/` directories are disposable and ignored by Git.

On portable, `npm run dev` uses `vinext dev` with HMR, starting at port 5173. Vinext records the running server in ignored `.vinext/` state, rejects an ordinary duplicate launch, and recovers stale state after a stopped process; exactly simultaneous starts can race. Pass `--port <port>` or `--hostname <host>` after `npm run dev --` when needed; keep portable previews on loopback.

For browser QA on managed Linux, use `sites-preview start`. The project's dev script runs Vite and accepts the supervisor's `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173 --strictPort` arguments. The internal browser uses `http://terminal.local:4173/`; it is not a user-facing URL. The supervisor owns the preview lifecycle. The ignored local profile survives the supervisor's cleared process environment.

The workspace uses its own username/password session and D1 membership records. The optional starter authentication helper described below is not used by the application login page.

The Worker uses `vinext/server/fetch-handler`, including Vinext's config-aware image handling. After building, `npm start` runs that Worker locally through Wrangler on `127.0.0.1`, sharing `.wrangler/state` with dev preview and local D1 migrations; it does not deploy the site or simulate sign-in. Use the URL printed by the server. Pass `npm start -- --port <port>` to select a different built-preview port.

Local previews use Miniflare's placeholder `Request.cf` metadata without a network lookup. Set `CLOUDFLARE_CF_FETCH_ENABLED=true` to opt into fetching preview metadata; this setting does not change hosted request metadata.

Local tool usage metrics are disabled by default. Set `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=true` to opt in.

## Included Shape

- edit site code under `app/`
- `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` is an unused starter helper; workspace login uses `app/admin-auth.ts`
- `.openai/hosting.json` declares optional Sites D1 and R2 bindings
- `vite.config.ts` simulates declared bindings for local development
- `db/index.ts` reads the D1 binding from the Cloudflare Worker environment
- `db/schema.ts` starts intentionally empty
- `@cloudflare/workers-types` provides Worker types; `cloudflare-env.d.ts` declares optional `DB`/`BUCKET` bindings—update these declarations if binding names change
- `examples/d1/` contains an optional D1 example surface
- `drizzle.config.ts` supports local migration generation when needed

## Workspace Auth Headers

Signed-in visitors receive both `oai-authenticated-user-id` and `oai-authenticated-user-email`. Private Sites require every visitor to sign in; public Sites may also have anonymous visitors, for whom neither header is present.

The user ID is stable for the same user on the same Site and different across Sites. Use it as the durable user key; use email and name for display or contact purposes.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive `oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty `name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by `oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const userId = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-id");
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") ===
      "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```

## Optional Dispatch-Owned ChatGPT Sign-In

This starter reference is retained for future hosting integrations. Puzzle Alliance OS does not expose it on the login page and does not use it for workspace membership.

Import the ready-to-use helpers from `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` when the site needs optional or required ChatGPT sign-in:

- Use `getChatGPTUser()` for optional signed-in UI.
- Use the returned `userId` as the stable user key for user-owned records; do not use email as a durable identifier.
- Use `requireChatGPTUser(returnTo)` for server-rendered pages that should send anonymous visitors through Sign in with ChatGPT.
- In a Server Component, start sign-in with `<a href={chatGPTSignInPath(returnTo)} target="_top">`. The auth helper module is server-only; do not import it into a Client Component.
- Do not use `fetch`, XHR, a client-side router, or a framework link that can prefetch the sign-in route. SIWC must start as a top-level navigation.
- Never request the AuthAPI authorization endpoint directly. The dispatch-owned `/signin-with-chatgpt` route must start the SIWC flow.
- Use `chatGPTSignOutPath(returnTo)` for browser sign-out links or actions.
- Pass a same-origin relative `returnTo` path for the destination after sign-in or sign-out. The helper validates and safely encodes it.
- Mark protected pages with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because they depend on per-request identity headers.

Dispatch owns `/signin-with-chatgpt`, `/signout-with-chatgpt`, `/callback`, the OAuth cookies, and identity header injection. Do not implement app routes for those reserved paths. Routes that do not import and call the helper remain anonymous-compatible.

SIWC establishes identity only; it does not prove workspace membership. Use the Sites hosting platform's access policy controls for workspace-wide restrictions, or enforce explicit server-side membership or allowlist checks.

Use SIWC for account pages, user-specific dashboards, saved records, and write actions tied to the current ChatGPT user. Leave public content anonymous.

## Local D1 migrations

For a D1-backed local preview, generate SQL with `npm run db:generate`. Build once through the Sites skill's build entrypoint (or `npm run build` for standalone use) to generate `dist/server/wrangler.json`, rebuilding if bindings change. From the project root, apply each pending migration in order:

```sh
node --import ./scripts/sites-env.mjs ./node_modules/wrangler/bin/wrangler.js d1 execute DB --local --config dist/server/wrangler.json --persist-to .wrangler/state --file drizzle/0000_example.sql
```

Replace the filename with the pending migration and `DB` with your D1 binding name if different. Use `.wrangler/state`, not `.wrangler/state/v3`; Wrangler adds the versioned directories. Do not replay migrations already applied locally. This updates only the preview database; publishing applies production migrations separately.

## Diagnostic Commands

- `npm run install:ci`: perform the one locked dependency install
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite/Vinext development server
- `npm run build`: build the deployable Sites artifact
- `npm run start`: preview the built Worker locally with D1/R2 support
- `npm run db:generate`: generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes

When using the Sites plugin, follow its skill instructions for installation, builds, and publishing. These npm commands remain available for standalone use.

The portable build runs Vinext directly without a host `timeout` command. The managed-linux build uses `scripts/build-verified.sh` and its existing `SITES_BUILD_TIMEOUT` setting.
